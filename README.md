# SensorHousing
Sensor housing used to accomodate a [Honeywell HPM particle sensor] (https://sensing.honeywell.com/sensors/particle-sensors/hpm-series) and a HTU21D Temperature and Humidty sensor.

This housing is using a 75 mm PVC sleeve on which a 3D printed cap is placed at both ends. 
One cap has an entry for a UTP cable to access the interior of the housing. In the sleeve a mounting ring is placed that hold the Honeywell HPM sensor and the PCB with the HTU sensor. By modifying the mounting ring any sensor can be installed inside the sleeve.

## STL files
For 3D printing the STL files are made available.

## Sketchup files
The parts are designed using Sketchup 8 and converted to STL using Sketchup-free (web edition). 

## Artist impressions
For the purpose of reproduction two images are provided to see how the sensor housing is constructed. These are in "Pictures".

## BOM
for this Sensor housing is needed:
    - a 75 mm PVC sleeve
    - PLA for 3D printing
